Fix: Accurate GP calculations with detailed cost breakdowns

Major fixes to admin deals analysis:

1. GP Calculation Fix
   - Fixed GP formula to include Finance Fee
   - Rep GP = Payout - Hardware - Installation - Finance Fee - Settlement
   - Actual GP = Payout - HardwareCost - ActualInstallation - Finance Fee - Settlement
   - GP difference now calculates correctly

2. Installation Cost Breakdown
   - Added detailed breakdown for Rep (user/manager pricing)
   - Added detailed breakdown for Actual (cost pricing)
   - Shows: Sliding Scale + Extension Cost + Fuel Cost
   - Both Rep and Actual calculations now visible

3. Item Breakdown Fix
   - Added user/manager pricing to item breakdown
   - Shows both admin cost and user/manager price per item
   - Profit per item now calculates correctly
   - Fixed R0.00 display issue

4. Calculation Accuracy
   - Uses saved totals for customer pricing (no recalculation)
   - Calculates cost pricing fresh for GP analysis
   - Proper separation of hardware deals vs monthly recurring
   - All cost components now visible and accurate

Documentation added:
- CALCULATION_ACCURACY_ANALYSIS.md
- GP_CALCULATION_FIX.md
- ITEM_BREAKDOWN_FIX.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- TESTING_CALCULATIONS.md
- QUICK_START_TESTING.md

All calculations now match between Total Costs and Admin Deals sections.

# Supabase Sync Migration Summary

## Quick Overview

This migration adds support for syncing activity logs, deals, and scraper data from localStorage to Supabase for cross-device access.

2. **test-supabase-sync-schema.sql** - Test script with sample data
3. **SUPABASE_SYNC_SETUP.md** - Complete setup guide
4. **SUPABASE_SYNC_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Developer quick reference
5. **SUPABASE_SYNC_COLUMN_NAMES.md** - Column naming conventions guide
6. **MIGRATION_SAFETY.md** - Safety guarantees and rollback plan
7. **MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md** - This file

## What Gets Added

### New Tables (3)

1. **activity_logs** - User activity timeline
   - Tracks: deal_created, deal_saved, proposal_generated, pdf_generated, deal_loaded
   - Columns: id, userId, username, userRole, activityType, dealId, dealName, timestamp, metadata
   - Indexes: userId, activityType, timestamp
   - RLS: Users see own, admins see all

2. **scraper_industries** - Custom industries for scraper
   - Columns: id, name, userId, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt
   - Indexes: name, userId, isActive
   - RLS: All users see active, users manage own, admins manage all

3. **scraper_saved_sessions** - Saved scraper configurations
   - Columns: id, userId, sessionName, towns, industries, config, createdAt, updatedAt
   - Indexes: userId, createdAt
   - RLS: Users see own, admins see all

### Indexes Added

- `activity_logs`: 4 indexes for performance
- `deal_calculations`: 2 indexes (if not exist)
- `scraper_industries`: 3 indexes
- `scraper_saved_sessions`: 2 indexes

### RLS Policies Added

- **activity_logs**: 3 policies (view own, insert own, admins view all)
- **deal_calculations**: 6 policies (replaces permissive policy)
- **scraper_industries**: 4 policies (view active, insert, update own, delete own)
- **scraper_saved_sessions**: 4 policies (view own, insert own, update own, delete own)

### Helper Views Added

- `recent_activity_logs` - Last 100 activities per user
- `user_deal_stats` - Deal statistics by user

## What Does NOT Change

✅ **NO changes to existing table structures**
✅ **NO changes to existing data**
✅ **NO changes to column types**
✅ **NO changes to primary/foreign keys**
✅ **NO changes to existing constraints**

The only change to existing tables is:
- Adding indexes to `deal_calculations` (if they don't exist)
- Replacing permissive RLS policy with secure policies

## How to Run

### Step 1: Backup (Recommended)
Supabase provides automatic backups, but you can create a manual backup in the dashboard.

### Step 2: Run Migration
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste contents of: supabase-sync-migration.sql
-- Click "Run"
```

Expected output:
- Tables created successfully
- Indexes created successfully
- RLS policies created successfully
- Sample data inserted (optional)
- Success message displayed

### Step 3: Verify (Optional)
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste contents of: test-supabase-sync-schema.sql
-- Click "Run"
```

Expected output:
- All tests pass
- Sample data inserted
- Query performance verified
- RLS policies validated

### Step 4: Update Application Code
See `SUPABASE_SYNC_SETUP.md` for implementation details.

## Requirements Met

✅ **3.1** - activity_logs table with all required columns and indexes
✅ **3.2** - deal_calculations table structure verified (no changes needed)
✅ **3.3** - Indexes on userId, activityType, timestamp for performance
✅ **3.4** - Row Level Security policies for user isolation
✅ **3.5** - Sample test data included for verification

## Column Naming

The migration respects your existing naming conventions:

- **deal_calculations**: Uses camelCase (`userId`, `createdAt`, `dealName`)
- **scraper_sessions**: Uses snake_case (`userid`, `sessionid`)
- **New tables**: Use camelCase for consistency with deal_calculations

All SQL queries use quoted identifiers for camelCase columns: `"userId"`, `"createdAt"`, etc.

## RLS Policy Impact

The migration replaces the permissive "allow all" policy on `deal_calculations` with secure policies:

**Before:**
- Anyone can do anything (development mode)

**After:**
- Users can only access their own deals
- Admins can access all deals
- Proper authentication required

**Action Required:**
- Ensure users are authenticated via Supabase Auth
- Ensure user roles are set correctly in `users` table
- Test that users can access their own data

## Rollback

If needed, you can rollback the RLS policies:

```sql
-- Drop new policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own deals" ON deal_calculations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own deals" ON deal_calculations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own deals" ON deal_calculations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own deals" ON deal_calculations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all deals" ON deal_calculations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete any deal" ON deal_calculations;

-- Restore permissive policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow all deal operations" ON deal_calculations 
FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

To remove new tables (not recommended):
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS activity_logs CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS scraper_industries CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS scraper_saved_sessions CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS recent_activity_logs;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS user_deal_stats;
```

## Next Steps

After running the migration:

1. ✅ Verify tables created successfully
2. ✅ Run test script to validate
3. ✅ Update application code to use Supabase
4. ✅ Implement migration handler for localStorage data
5. ✅ Test with real users
6. ✅ Monitor Supabase logs for errors
7. ✅ Deploy to production

2. **Record these values**:
   ```
   Extension Count: _______
   Hardware Total: R_______
   Installation Cost: R_______
   Gross Profit: R_______
   Finance Fee: R_______
   Settlement: R_______
   Total Payout: R_______
   
   Hardware Rental: R_______ /month
   Connectivity Cost: R_______ /month
   Licensing Cost: R_______ /month
   Total MRC: R_______ /month
   Factor Used: _______
   ```

### Step 3: Generate PDF from Total Costs
1. Click "Generate PDF" button
2. PDF should download and open
3. **Verify**: All values in PDF match what you recorded above âœ…

### Step 4: Save the Deal
1. Click "Save Deal" button
2. Wait for success message

### Step 5: View in Admin Deals
1. Logout and login as Admin
2. Navigate to Admin â†’ All Deals
3. Find "Test Customer 1" deal
4. Click "View Analysis" or "Generate PDF"

### Step 6: Verify Customer Pricing Matches
**Compare these values with Step 2**:
```
Customer Pricing Section:
- Hardware Total: Should match âœ…
- Installation Cost: Should match âœ…
- Gross Profit: Should match âœ…
- Finance Fee: Should match âœ…
- Settlement: Should match âœ…
- Total Payout: Should match âœ…

Monthly Revenue:
- Connectivity: Should match âœ…
- Licensing: Should match âœ…
```

### Step 7: Verify Cost Analysis is Shown
**Check that these are displayed**:
```
Cost Analysis Section:
- Hardware Cost: R_______ (should be less than Hardware Total)
- Installation Cost: R_______ (should be less than Installation Cost)
- Total Costs: R_______

GP Analysis:
- Actual GP: R_______ (should be positive)
- GP %: _______% (should be reasonable, e.g., 20-40%)

Monthly Cost Analysis:
- Connectivity Cost: R_______ (should be less than Connectivity Revenue)
- Licensing Cost: R_______ (should be less than Licensing Revenue)
- Monthly GP: R_______ (should be positive)
- Monthly GP %: _______% (should be reasonable)
```

## Test Scenario 2: Edge Case - High Extensions

### Setup
- **Hardware**: 35 extensions (to test 33+ band)
- **Term**: 60 months
- **Escalation**: 0%
- **Settlement**: R0

### Expected Behavior
- Installation cost should use "33+" band
- Finance fee should be calculated correctly
- All calculations should still match between views

---

## Test Scenario 3: Edge Case - Zero Settlement

### Setup
- **Hardware**: 10 extensions
- **Term**: 36 months
- **Escalation**: 10%
- **Settlement**: R0

### Expected Behavior
- GP calculation should not include settlement
- All other calculations should work normally

---

## Test Scenario 4: Monthly Separation

### Verification Points
1. **Hardware Deal Section** should show:
   - Hardware Total
   - Installation Cost
   - Gross Profit
   - Finance Fee
   - Settlement
   - **Total Payout** (this is the hardware deal value)

2. **Monthly Recurring Section** should show:
   - Connectivity (monthly)
   - Licensing (monthly)
   - **NOT** Hardware Rental (that's part of hardware deal)

3. **Hardware Rental** should be shown as:
   - Part of Total MRC
   - Calculated as: Total Payout Ã— Factor

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Customer Pricing Doesn't Match
**Symptom**: Values in Admin Deals don't match Total Costs

**Solution**:
1. Check if deal was saved properly
2. Verify `totals` object exists in saved deal
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue 2: Cost Pricing Shows Zero
**Symptom**: All cost prices show R0.00

**Solution**:
1. Check admin config has cost pricing set
2. Verify items have `cost` field populated
3. Check scales have admin cost data

### Issue 3: GP Calculation Seems Wrong
**Symptom**: GP is negative or unreasonably high

**Solution**:
1. Verify formula: `GP = Payout - Hardware Cost - Installation Cost - Settlement`
2. Check that settlement is not being double-counted
3. Verify cost pricing is using admin costs, not user/manager costs

### Issue 4: Monthly GP Includes Hardware Rental
**Symptom**: Monthly GP seems too high

**Solution**:
1. Verify monthly GP only includes connectivity + licensing
2. Hardware rental should NOT be in monthly GP calculation
3. Hardware rental is part of hardware deal (payout Ã— factor)

# UI Consistency Fixes Needed

## Issue
The Deal Details, Settlement, and Total Costs sections were upgraded with modern UI but may have inconsistencies compared to Hardware, Licensing, and Connectivity sections.

## Standard Pattern (from Hardware/Licensing/Connectivity)

### Imports
```tsx
import { GradientText, FloatingInput, MagneticButton, GlassCard } from '@/components/ui/modern';
```

### Structure
1. **Header** - GradientText with icon and description
2. **Content** - GlassCard with `glow` prop
3. **Inputs** - FloatingInput components
4. **Buttons** - MagneticButton components
5. **Tables** - Standard HTML tables with Tailwind styling
6. **NO 3D HOVER EFFECTS** - User specifically requested removal

### Key Components Used
- `GlassCard` - with `glow` prop for emphasis
- `FloatingInput` - for all text/number inputs
- `MagneticButton` - for all buttons
- `GradientText` - for section titles
- Standard HTML elements with Tailwind classes

### What NOT to Use
- ❌ Card3D component (3D hover effects removed per user request)
- ❌ hover3D prop on GlassCard
- ❌ Any 3D tilt effects

## Sections to Review

### ✅ Hardware Section - CORRECT PATTERN
- Uses GlassCard with glow
- Uses FloatingInput
- Uses MagneticButton
- No 3D effects

### ✅ Licensing Section - CORRECT PATTERN
- Uses GlassCard with glow
- Uses FloatingInput
- Uses MagneticButton
- No 3D effects

### ✅ Connectivity Section - CORRECT PATTERN
- Uses GlassCard with glow
- Uses FloatingInput
- Uses MagneticButton
- No 3D effects

### ⚠️ Deal Details Section - NEEDS REVIEW
- Check if using correct components
- Ensure no 3D effects
- Verify consistent styling

### ⚠️ Settlement Section - NEEDS REVIEW
- Check if using correct components
- Ensure no 3D effects
- Verify consistent styling

### ⚠️ Total Costs Section - NEEDS REVIEW
- Check if using correct components
- Ensure no 3D effects
- Verify consistent styling

## Action Items

1. Review Deal Details Section
2. Review Settlement Section  
3. Review Total Costs Section
4. Ensure all use same component pattern
5. Remove any 3D hover effects
6. Verify consistent animations
7. Test all sections for visual consistency

## Notes
- All sections should feel cohesive
- Same animation timing and effects
- Consistent color scheme
- Same glassmorphism intensity
- No jarring visual differences between sections

  - Skeleton loading for deal cards (6 cards during initial load)
  - Loading state tracking for delete operations (`isDeleting` state)
  - Item-specific loading indicators on delete buttons
  - Disabled state during async operations
  - Better visual feedback during data loading

#### Admin Deals Page (`src/app/admin/deals/page.tsx`)

  - Loading state tracking for PDF generation (`isGeneratingPDF` state)
  - Loading state tracking for delete operations (`isDeleting` state)
  - Item-specific loading indicators on all action buttons
  - Disabled states during async operations
  - Spinner animations on buttons during processing
  - Better perceived performance with skeleton cards

### 4. CSS Enhancements

#### Global Styles (`src/app/globals.css`)
- **Added**:
  - Shimmer animation keyframes for skeleton loading
  - `.animate-shimmer` utility class
  - Smooth background position animation for wave effect

### 5. Component Exports

#### UI Index (`src/components/ui/index.ts`)
- **Updated**:
  - Exported all new loading components
  - Maintained backward compatibility
  - Clean import paths for developers

### 6. Documentation

#### Loading States Documentation (`LOADING_STATES.md`)
- **Created comprehensive guide covering**:
  - Component overview and features
  - Usage examples for each component
  - Implementation patterns and best practices
  - Accessibility considerations
  - Real-world examples
  - Future enhancement suggestions

#### Demo Page (`src/app/loading-demo/page.tsx`)
- **Created interactive showcase**:
  - All button loading states (variants and sizes)
  - All spinner variations (sizes and colors)
  - All skeleton components
  - LoadingState component examples
  - Real-world usage patterns
  - Interactive demonstrations

## Requirements Addressed

### ✅ Requirement 3.4: Enhanced User Interactions
- Implemented consistent loading indicators across all async operations
- Added button loading states with visual feedback
- Improved form interaction feedback during submissions

### ✅ Requirement 4.2: Clear User Feedback
- All user actions now have clear loading feedback
- Implemented skeleton loading for better perceived performance
- Added disabled states to prevent duplicate actions
- Included meaningful loading messages

### ✅ Requirement 6.3: Proper Loading States
- Implemented skeleton screens for initial page loads
- Added inline spinners for button actions
- Created overlay spinners for blocking operations
- Consistent loading patterns across the application

### ✅ Requirement 6.4: Smooth Animations
- Smooth spinner rotations
- Shimmer effect for skeleton loading
- Pulse animations for loading states
- Transition effects on button states
- No janky or abrupt state changes

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Item-specific loading tracking
const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [isGeneratingPDF, setIsGeneratingPDF] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Usage
const handleDelete = async (id: string) => {
  setIsDeleting(id);
  try {
    await deleteItem(id);
  } finally {
    setIsDeleting(null);
  }
};
```

### Skeleton Loading Pattern
```typescript
if (isLoading) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {Array.from({ length: 6 }).map((_, i) => (
        <SkeletonCard key={i} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Button Loading Pattern
```typescript
<Button
  loading={isDeleting === item.id}
  disabled={isDeleting === item.id}
  onClick={() => handleDelete(item.id)}
>
  Delete
</Button>
```

## Testing Performed

### ✅ Component Compilation
- All new components compile without TypeScript errors
- No linting issues
- Proper type definitions

### ✅ Visual Testing
- Skeleton loading displays correctly
- Spinners animate smoothly
- Button loading states work as expected
- No layout shifts during loading

### ✅ Accessibility
- ARIA attributes present on all loading components
- Screen reader compatible
- Keyboard navigation maintained during loading states

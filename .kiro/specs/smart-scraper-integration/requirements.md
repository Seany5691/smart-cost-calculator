# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the Smart Scraper application into the Smart Cost Calculator main application. The Smart Scraper is a fully functional business intelligence scraping tool that needs to be integrated as a new feature within the main app, with access restricted to Admin and Manager roles only. The integration involves adding navigation elements, implementing role-based access control, and migrating all scraper functionality while maintaining the existing UI/UX consistency between both applications.

## Glossary

- **Main App**: The Smart Cost Calculator application located at `smart-cost-calculator/`
- **Scraper App**: The Smart Scraper application located at `smart-scraper/`
- **Dashboard**: The main landing page of the Main App showing quick action cards
- **Navigation Bar**: The top navigation component that provides links to different sections of the Main App
- **Admin**: A user with the role 'admin' who has full system access
- **Manager**: A user with the role 'manager' who has elevated permissions
- **Regular User**: A user with the role 'user' who has standard permissions
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A security mechanism that restricts system access based on user roles
- **Smart Scraper**: The business intelligence scraping feature being integrated
- **Quick Action Card**: A clickable card on the Dashboard that navigates to a specific feature

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Admin or Manager, I want to access the Smart Scraper feature from the Dashboard, so that I can quickly navigate to the scraping functionality

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Dashboard page loads, THE Main App SHALL display a "Smart Scraper" Quick Action Card if the authenticated user has role 'admin' or 'manager'
2. WHEN the Dashboard page loads, THE Main App SHALL hide the "Smart Scraper" Quick Action Card if the authenticated user has role 'user'
3. WHEN an Admin or Manager clicks the "Smart Scraper" Quick Action Card, THE Main App SHALL navigate to '/scraper' route
4. THE Main App SHALL display the "Smart Scraper" Quick Action Card with an appropriate icon and description consistent with existing Dashboard cards
5. THE Main App SHALL position the "Smart Scraper" Quick Action Card within the Dashboard grid layout following existing design patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Admin or Manager, I want to see the Smart Scraper link in the navigation bar, so that I can access the scraping feature from any page in the application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Navigation Bar renders, THE Main App SHALL display a "Smart Scraper" navigation item if the authenticated user has role 'admin' or 'manager'
2. WHEN the Navigation Bar renders, THE Main App SHALL hide the "Smart Scraper" navigation item if the authenticated user has role 'user'
3. WHEN an Admin or Manager clicks the "Smart Scraper" navigation item, THE Main App SHALL navigate to '/scraper' route
4. THE Main App SHALL display the "Smart Scraper" navigation item with an appropriate icon consistent with existing navigation items
5. THE Main App SHALL highlight the "Smart Scraper" navigation item when the current route is '/scraper'

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Regular User, I want to be prevented from accessing the Smart Scraper feature, so that the system maintains proper access control

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. THE Main App SHALL validate user role on the server-side for all scraper-related API endpoints
5. THE Main App SHALL return HTTP 403 status code when unauthorized users attempt to access scraper API endpoints

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Admin or Manager, I want the Smart Scraper interface to work seamlessly within the Main App, so that I have a consistent user experience

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Main App SHALL render the Smart Scraper page using the existing layout component with Navigation Bar
2. THE Main App SHALL display all Smart Scraper components exactly as designed in the Scraper App
3. THE Main App SHALL maintain all existing Smart Scraper styling without modifications
4. THE Main App SHALL preserve all Smart Scraper responsive design patterns
5. THE Main App SHALL integrate Smart Scraper components without requiring UI changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Admin or Manager, I want all Smart Scraper functionality to work seamlessly within the Main App, so that I can perform business intelligence scraping without issues

4. THE Main App SHALL support all export functionality from the Scraper App including Excel export and provider-specific exports
5. THE Main App SHALL support all lookup functionality from the Scraper App including number lookup and business lookup
6. THE Main App SHALL maintain all Scraper App state management using Zustand store
7. THE Main App SHALL support session save and load functionality from the Scraper App
8. THE Main App SHALL display real-time progress updates during scraping operations
9. THE Main App SHALL display activity logs and summary statistics from scraping operations
10. THE Main App SHALL support all concurrency control settings from the Scraper App

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Scraper App dependencies to be properly integrated into the Main App, so that all scraping functionality has the required libraries

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Main App SHALL include all Scraper App dependencies in its package.json file

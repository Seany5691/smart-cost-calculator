# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the Smart Cost Calculator application's performance specifically for mobile devices. The system currently experiences significant lag on mobile devices due to multiple simultaneous database queries, heavy animations, and lack of pagination. This feature will implement mobile-specific optimizations while maintaining full functionality on desktop devices.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard**: The main landing page displaying user statistics and recent activity
- **ActivityTimeline**: Component displaying recent user activities with filtering capabilities
- **Mobile Device**: Any device with a screen width less than 768px (tablet and phone form factors)
- **Supabase**: The backend database service used for data persistence
- **Pagination**: Loading data in smaller chunks rather than all at once
- **Debouncing**: Delaying function execution until after a specified time has passed since the last invocation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the dashboard to load quickly, so that I can access my deals without waiting

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Dashboard loads on a mobile device, THE System SHALL combine all statistics queries into a single Supabase request
2. WHEN the Dashboard loads on a mobile device, THE System SHALL display loading skeletons for statistics cards
3. WHEN statistics data is fetched, THE System SHALL cache the results for 5 minutes to avoid redundant requests
4. WHEN the user navigates back to the Dashboard within the cache period, THE System SHALL display cached data immediately
5. WHERE the device screen width is 768px or greater, THE System SHALL use the existing multi-query approach

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want smooth scrolling through activity logs, so that the interface feels responsive

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ActivityTimeline loads on a mobile device, THE System SHALL fetch only the 20 most recent activity records initially
2. WHEN the user scrolls to the bottom of the activity list, THE System SHALL load the next 20 records
3. WHEN loading additional activity records, THE System SHALL display a loading indicator at the bottom of the list
4. WHEN all activity records have been loaded, THE System SHALL display a "No more activities" message
5. WHERE the device screen width is 768px or greater, THE System SHALL load 50 records initially

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want reduced animations, so that the app performs smoothly on my device

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Dashboard renders on a mobile device, THE System SHALL disable staggered animation delays
2. WHEN components animate on a mobile device, THE System SHALL use CSS transform and opacity only
3. WHEN the AnimatedBackground component renders on a mobile device, THE System SHALL reduce particle count by 75%
4. WHEN hover effects trigger on a mobile device, THE System SHALL use simpler transitions with shorter durations
5. WHERE the device screen width is 768px or greater, THE System SHALL use full animation effects

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the admin dropdown to respond quickly, so that I can filter activities without delay

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin changes the user filter on a mobile device, THE System SHALL debounce the activity fetch by 300 milliseconds
2. WHEN the debounce timer is active, THE System SHALL display a loading state on the dropdown
3. WHEN multiple filter changes occur rapidly, THE System SHALL cancel pending requests
4. WHEN the filter change completes, THE System SHALL reset pagination to the first page
5. WHERE the device screen width is 768px or greater, THE System SHALL use a 150 millisecond debounce

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want visual feedback during loading, so that I know the app is working

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any data is loading on a mobile device, THE System SHALL display skeleton loaders matching the content layout
2. WHEN the ActivityTimeline is loading, THE System SHALL show 5 skeleton activity cards
3. WHEN statistics are loading, THE System SHALL show skeleton stat cards with pulsing animation
4. WHEN an error occurs during data fetch, THE System SHALL display an error message with a retry button
5. WHEN the retry button is clicked, THE System SHALL attempt to reload the failed data

# Task 3 Implementation Summary

## Optimize Dashboard Statistics Queries for Mobile

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Supabase RPC Function (`get_dashboard_stats`)

Created a new SQL migration file at `migrations/get_dashboard_stats_rpc.sql` that defines an optimized database function to fetch all dashboard statistics in a single query.

**Features:**
- Combines three separate queries (total deals, active projects, calculations) into one
- Supports both admin and regular user filtering
- Returns JSON object with all statistics
- Marked as `SECURITY DEFINER` for proper access control
- Includes proper indexing considerations

**Location:** `smart-cost-calculator/migrations/get_dashboard_stats_rpc.sql`

#### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Stats Service

Updated `src/lib/dashboardStats.ts` with the new `getDashboardStatsOptimized()` function.

**Key Features:**

##### Device-Aware Query Strategy
- **Mobile devices:** Uses single optimized RPC call to `get_dashboard_stats`
- **Desktop devices:** Uses existing multi-query approach with `Promise.all`

##### Two-Tier Caching System
- **Memory Cache:** 5-minute TTL for fast repeated access
- **localStorage Cache:** 15-minute TTL for persistence across page navigations

##### Robust Error Handling
- Falls back to expired localStorage cache if Supabase fails
- Falls back to localStorage deals/activity logs as last resort
- Returns zeros only if all fallback mechanisms fail

##### Cache Invalidation
- Updated `invalidateStatsCache()` to clear both memory and localStorage caches
- Ensures data consistency when deals or activities are modified

#### 3. New TypeScript Interfaces

Added proper type definitions:

```typescript
export interface DashboardStats {
  totalDeals: number;
  activeProjects: number;
  calculations: number;
}

interface DashboardStatsCacheEntry {
  data: DashboardStats;
  timestamp: number;
  expiresAt: number;
}
```

#### 4. Documentation

Created `migrations/README.md` with:
- Migration purpose and benefits
- How to apply the migration
- Function signature and parameters
- Testing instructions
- Rollback procedure

### How to Use

```typescript
import { getDashboardStatsOptimized } from '@/lib/dashboardStats';

// In your component
const stats = await getDashboardStatsOptimized(
  userId,
  isAdmin,
  isMobile  // Pass true for mobile devices
);

console.log(stats.totalDeals);
console.log(stats.activeProjects);
console.log(stats.calculations);
```

### Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced Network Requests:** 3 queries → 1 query on mobile
2. **Faster Load Times:** Single round trip to database
3. **Persistent Caching:** Data survives page refreshes
4. **Offline Resilience:** Multiple fallback mechanisms

### Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 1.1:** Single Supabase request for mobile devices  
✅ **Requirement 1.3:** 5-minute cache for statistics data  
✅ **Requirement 1.4:** Display cached data on return visits  
✅ **Requirement 1.5:** Desktop uses existing multi-query approach  

### Next Steps

1. Apply the SQL migration to your Supabase database
2. Update the Dashboard page component to use `getDashboardStatsOptimized()`
3. Pass the `isMobile` flag from the `useIsMobile` hook (Task 1)
4. Test on both mobile and desktop devices

### Files Modified

- `src/lib/dashboardStats.ts` - Added optimized function and caching
- `migrations/get_dashboard_stats_rpc.sql` - New RPC function
- `migrations/README.md` - Migration documentation

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Apply SQL migration to Supabase
- [ ] Test RPC function directly in Supabase SQL editor
- [ ] Test with admin user on mobile
- [ ] Test with regular user on mobile
- [ ] Test with admin user on desktop
- [ ] Test with regular user on desktop
- [ ] Verify memory cache works (repeated calls within 5 minutes)
- [ ] Verify localStorage cache works (page refresh within 15 minutes)
- [ ] Test error handling (disconnect from Supabase)
- [ ] Verify cache invalidation works when deals are modified

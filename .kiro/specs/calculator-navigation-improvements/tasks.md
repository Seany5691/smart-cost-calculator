# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enable direct tab navigation with click handlers








  - Update tab button elements to include onClick handlers that call handleTabChange
  - Modify the disabled attribute logic to only disable future tabs (index > tabIndex)
  - Update cursor styles: accessible tabs get cursor-pointer, locked tabs get cursor-not-allowed
  - Add hover state transitions for accessible tabs (scale and shadow effects)
  - Remove pointer-events-none class from accessible tabs
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 2. Fix completion checkmark visual cutoff
  - Change tab button container overflow from default to overflow-visible
  - Update completion indicator positioning to use absolute positioning with translate transform
  - Increase checkmark badge size from w-4 h-4 to w-5 h-5 for better visibility
  - Adjust transform values to translate(25%, -25%) to ensure badge is fully visible outside tab bounds
  - Add z-index: 10 to completion badge to prevent overlap issues
  - Test checkmark visibility on completed tabs at various screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Reduce navigation vertical space consumption





  - Reduce tab button padding from py-4 to py-3 (or py-2.5)
  - Reduce navigation controls container padding from py-4 to py-3
  - Combine step counter and progress percentage into single compact element
  - Simplify progress indicator by removing redundant elements (keep only essential progress bar and step text)
  - Remove or minimize the navigation hints text on desktop (keep minimal version)
  - Reduce spacing between tab bar and navigation controls sections
  - Consolidate the three-row navigation layout into a more compact two-row design
  - Test that total navigation height is reduced to approximately 104px or less on desktop
  - Verify mobile touch targets remain at least 44px for accessibility
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 4. Update tab interaction feedback and accessibility
  - Ensure tab buttons have proper aria-label attributes describing their state
  - Add aria-disabled="true" to locked/future tabs
  - Update tooltip positioning for locked tabs to ensure visibility
  - Verify keyboard navigation (arrow keys, number keys) still works correctly with clickable tabs
  - Test that focus indicators are visible when navigating with keyboard
  - Verify screen reader announces tab states correctly (completed, current, locked)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

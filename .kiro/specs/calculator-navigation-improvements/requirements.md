# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The calculator navigation system needs improvements to enhance usability and visual design. Currently, users can only navigate between calculator sections using Next/Previous buttons, but cannot directly click on tabs to jump to specific sections. Additionally, the completion checkmarks are being visually cut off, and the navigation area consumes excessive vertical space, reducing the available area for calculator content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Direct Tab Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click directly on any completed or current tab to navigate to that section, so that I can quickly jump to specific parts of the calculator without clicking Next/Previous multiple times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on the current tab THEN the system SHALL remain on that tab
2. WHEN a user clicks on any previously completed tab THEN the system SHALL navigate to that tab immediately
3. WHEN a user clicks on a future/incomplete tab THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip indicating the tab is not yet accessible
4. WHEN a user hovers over an accessible tab THEN the system SHALL show visual feedback (hover state)
5. IF a tab is accessible (current or completed) THEN the system SHALL display it with a clickable cursor style

### Requirement 2: Fix Completion Checkmark Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see completion checkmarks fully displayed on completed tabs, so that I can clearly identify which sections I have finished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tab is marked as completed THEN the system SHALL display the checkmark icon fully visible without any clipping
2. WHEN a checkmark is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure adequate padding and spacing to prevent visual cutoff
3. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain proper checkmark visibility
4. IF a tab has a completion indicator THEN the system SHALL position it within the tab boundaries without overflow issues

### Requirement 3: Reduce Navigation Vertical Space

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation area to be more compact, so that I have more screen space available to view and interact with calculator content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculator page loads THEN the system SHALL display navigation in a compact layout using no more than 120px of vertical space
2. WHEN displaying the tab bar THEN the system SHALL use efficient spacing and padding to minimize height
3. WHEN displaying the progress indicator THEN the system SHALL integrate it inline with navigation controls rather than as a separate row
4. WHEN displaying navigation buttons THEN the system SHALL use a single-row layout that combines tabs, progress, and controls efficiently
5. IF the user is on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain compact navigation while ensuring touch targets remain accessible (minimum 44px)
